# My 5-Year Goals, Ideals and Aspirations

### What is this?

This document serves as a tangible place, live on the internet where accountability is placed on myself (by you the reader) to achieve, attempt or remember what's listed within. 

That sounds a bit abstract, what's the intention of this document? This document is a way for me to write down everything I am hoping to accomplish or learn within the course of the next 5 years. The idea behind having this hosted online (on git in particular) is that the ability is provided for peers, co-workers and friends to see my goals and hold me accountable to them. Having this document part of a git repo ensures that anyone has access to it and that it cannot be edited without being noticed (no pulling 'sneaky backouts' on my part).

I want this document to be a way of solidifing and visualising what I am wanting to achieve within the next 5 years. I want the fufillment of those desires to be expected by you the reader.

### Breakdown

This list will be broken down into 4 categories of goals/lists:
*  **Software Engineering (and Computer Science) Goals:** These goals are what motivated me to create this document, the things I want to accomplish to become a better engineer and new ways to challenge myself.

*  **Technical Skill Goals:** Things that aren't necessarily directly related to Software Engineering these will be goals that require some form of learning and or routined practice. 

* **Personal Goals:**  These are goals that are related to my personal life and growth. These will usually be far more abstract than the others and harder to define success or failure for.

* **A list of software/technical books I am wanting to study within the next 5 years.** These may or may not be tied to the aforementioned goals in the above categories.

### Measures of Success 
Accountability and accomplishment requires a clearly defined set of measurements for success. I will be measuring the success, and/or fuffillment of a listed item based on whether or not I truly, and honestly believe I tried my absolute hardest to meet the goal as it was written. I don't believe that not meeting the goal as it's written is a complete failure; if I have learned something from my experience attempting the goal and maybe even produced a story to tell because of that very experience, then that in my eyes is a successful outcome.

### Review
I'll alter this section to detail how I'll go about reviewing my progress after the five years. That means that the cut-off date for success is **14/09/2026**.
